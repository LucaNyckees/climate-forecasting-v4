    The parameter stability plots involves plotting the modifed scale parameter and the shape parameter against the threshold $u$ for a range of threshold which has been chosen to go from the 80% quantile to the 99% quantile. The parameter estimates should be stable (i.e. constant) above the threshold at which the GPD model becomes valid. In practise, the mean excess values and parameter estimates are calculated from relatively small amounts of data, so the plots will not look either linear or constant even when the GPD model becomes valid. Confidence intervals are included, so that we can evaluate whether the plots look linear or constant once we have accounted for the effects of estimation uncertainty. This is not easy to do by eye, and the interpretation of these plots often requires a good deal of subjective judgement.

To do this, we used $m = 41$ threholds from the $85\%$ quantile for each month to the threshold which is such that only 30 observations of each month are above this threshold. We calculated the p-values using the score test based on the $\chi_{m-i}^2$ null distribution, $i = 1,... ,m-1$. Our selection method consists of choosing, for each month, the smallest threshold that does not allow us to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$. However, as we can see in the figure below, this method allows us, for some months, to reject our null hypothesis for any threshold above the 80% quantile of each month. This would mean that for these months, we would have to consider thresholds below the 80% quantile, but this would introduce too much bias in our model. In cases where our method allows us to select a threshold, it can be seen that this is generally higher than the 90% quantile. Although this method allows us to choose a threshold more objectively than the graphical methods based on the evaluation of mean residuals life plots and parameters stability plots, it still tends to choose too low thresholds.

A particular interest was given to the choice of the threshold to perform such an analysis. Indeed, the choice of the threshold affects the estimation of the GPD parameters. Different method were used to help the choice of the threshold: graphical diagnostics, rules of thumbs and statistical tests. Rules of thumb are easy to use since they choose one particular value from the series as the threshold. Graphical diagnostics consist in analysisng different plots, but are often very difficult to interpret as they usually require a lot of subjectivity. Finally, a other method using statistical tets was used, which is more demanding computationally, but gave results easier to interpret as the comparison od p-values is more straightforward. Nevertheless, in our case this method tended to give us much too low thresholds. Lastly, we chose to use the rule of thumb with the 90% quantile, as it gave us thresholds close to those found with the diagnostic plots. ")

To perform our study, we decided to avoidthis seasonnal variations and cut the data into different series for each month.

However, after further analysis of what exactly this declustering did, we realised that it was more or less the same as considering the maximum temperature of each month. This would lead us to change our approach in a future study and to use a block-maxima approach instead of a point-over-threshold approach. As for the results of our modelling, we ended up modelling the extremes of each month with a Gumbel distribution, except for February and April for which a model with negative shape parameters seemed more appropriate. As for the returns levels, we observed that those of February and April seemed to underestimate the maximum temperatures observed over the period under consideration, nevertheless for the other months the calculated returns levels are quite consistent with the observed maximums.")
